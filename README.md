# complexNetworkCentrality
Academic work from Complex Networks discipline at PESC/COPPE/UFRJ

Here, I choosed three graphs to get centrality measures in this work:

1. C. Elegans Neural Network (D. J. Watts and S. H. Strogatz, Nature 393, 440-442 (1998))
2. Political Blogs (L. A. Adamic and N. Glance, "The political blogosphere and the 2004 US Election", in Proceedings of the WWW-2005 Workshop on the Weblogging Ecosystem (2005))
3. Gnutella (J. Leskovec, J. Kleinberg and C. Faloutsos. Graph Evolution: Densification and Shrinking Diameters. ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (ACM TKDD), 1(1), 2007), (M. Ripeanu and I. Foster and A. Iamnitchi. Mapping the Gnutella Network: Properties of Large-Scale Peer-to-Peer Systems and Implications for System Design. IEEE Internet Computing Journal, 2002)

Centrality measures are:

1. Degree in
2. Degree out
3. Betweeness
4. Closeness
5. Katz
6. PageRank
